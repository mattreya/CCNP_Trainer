# Summary of Work Done (2025-08-18)

In this session, we made significant improvements to the CCNP Trainer CLI tool. Here's a summary of the key accomplishments:

## 1. Restructured the Question Bank

*   The question bank has been restructured into a directory-based system.
*   Questions are now organized by domain (e.g., `infrastructure`, `security`, `automation`) in the `question_bank` directory.
*   This makes it easier to manage and extend the question bank.

## 2. Improved the `/quizme` Command

*   The `/quizme` command is now more user-friendly.
*   When run without arguments, it displays a welcome message and a list of available topics.
*   This helps users discover the available quiz topics.

## 3. Added Instructions for Adding Questions

*   We determined that generating questions from the internet is unreliable.
*   Instead, we created an `INSTRUCTIONS.md` file that explains how users can add their own questions to the question bank.
*   This empowers users to contribute to the quiz and customize it to their needs.

## 4. GNS3 Integration

*   The GNS3 integration has been maintained.
*   The tool can still generate GNS3 configuration files for OSPF labs.

## 5. Code Quality and Testing

*   The code has been refactored and improved.
*   The unit tests have been updated to reflect the changes in the question bank structure.
*   All tests are passing, ensuring the stability of the application.

## Next Steps

*   **Expand the question bank:** Users can now add their own questions to the question bank by following the instructions in `INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
*   **Enhance GNS3 integration:** The GNS3 integration can be extended to support more topics and more complex topologies.
*   **Implement new features:** We can add new features to the quiz, such as different question types, hints, and explanations for the answers.
