      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a common enterprise network design principle?",
      "choices": [
        "A. Hierarchy",
        "B. Modularity",
        "C. Redundancy",
        "D. Complexity"
      ],
      "answer": "D. Complexity",
      "explanation": "Complexity is something to be avoided in network design, not a principle to be followed. The other options are all well-established design principles."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of a hierarchical network design?",
      "choices": [
        "A. To increase network complexity",
        "B. To make the network more difficult to manage",
        "C. To provide a predictable and scalable network",
        "D. To reduce the number of redundant links"
      ],
      "answer": "C. To provide a predictable and scalable network",
      "explanation": "A hierarchical network design provides a predictable and scalable network by dividing the network into distinct layers, each with its own function."

      "question": "Which of the following is a key advantage of on-premises infrastructure over cloud infrastructure?",
      "choices": [
        "A. Higher scalability",
        "B. Reduced upfront costs",
        "C. Greater control over data and security",
        "D. Faster deployment of new services"
      ],
      "answer": "C. Greater control over data and security",
      "explanation": "On-premises infrastructure typically offers organizations more direct control over their data, physical security, and compliance aspects compared to cloud solutions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes a characteristic of cloud infrastructure deployments?",
      "choices": [
        "A. High capital expenditure (CapEx)",
        "B. Pay-as-you-go operational expenditure (OpEx) model",
        "C. Full responsibility for hardware maintenance",
        "D. Limited access to global resources"
      ],
      "answer": "B. Pay-as-you-go operational expenditure (OpEx) model",
      "explanation": "Cloud infrastructure typically operates on a pay-as-you-go model, where costs are operational expenditures (OpEx) based on usage, rather than large upfront capital expenditures (CapEx)."
